## Things I'm confused about 

## After class TODO

## Notes 

## Object Oriented Design
- An object is an abstract data type with the addition of polymorphism and inheritance.
- Rather than structure programs as code and data, an object-oriented system integrates the two using the concept of an "object".
- An object has state (data) and behavior (code or method).
- C++ was invented to support objects as classes.

## Agile Manifesto 
- Individuals and interactions
  - over processes and tools
- Working software
  - over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration
  - over contract negotiation
- Responding to change
  - over following a plan

### Agile Principles (1)
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customerthrough early and continuous deliveryof valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from acouple of weeks to a couple of months, with apreference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must worktogether daily throughout the project.

### Agile Principles (2)
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

### Agile Principles (3)
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Agile methods
- Extreme Programming
- SCRUM
- Crystal
- Adaptive Software Development
- Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
- Feature Driven Development

## UML and Patterns
- “Applying UML and Patterns” by Craig Larman.
- UML = Unified Modeling Language
- An introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development.
- Larman strongly advocates against the waterfall model.

## Waterfall
- OK if requirements are fixed.
- In software, typically get 25% to 50% change in requirements.
- If an “iterative” project spends too much time on requirements, it has been afflicted with waterfall thinking.
- Instead, use feedback from early development and testing.

## Iterative Example
- Three-Week early iteration
  - Kickoff meeting – Clarify tasks and goals for the iteration.
  - One person makes UML diagrams from previous iteration.
  - On day 1, team works in pairs at whiteboards doing models.
  - On remaining days, implement, test, design, integrate, daily builds.
 
### Expanded example
- All iterations are timeboxed – they go for a certain fixed length of time.
- Let’s say there are 20 iterations.
- Put risky, high value, or difficult things in an early iteration.
- Each iteration ends with tested, production quality code.

### Before iteration 1:
- Hold a timeboxed (e.g. 2 days) requirements workshop.
- On the morning of day 1, do high-level requirements, such as just the names.
- Pick 10% of the requirements that have high risk or value or significantly impact the core architecture.
- For the remaining day and a half, do a detailed analysis of these requirements.
