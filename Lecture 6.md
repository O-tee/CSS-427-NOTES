## Notes Interrupts 

Atomicity
- An atom is the smallest unit of computer code.
- Atoms correspond to machine language instructions.
- Interrupts can only occur between code atoms.
- What is atomic on one architecture is not on another.
- Interrupts can occur in the middle of a single C instruction.
