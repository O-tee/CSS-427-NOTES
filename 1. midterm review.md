# Embedded systems
- A **microcontroller** contains a microprocessor, RAM, ROM and peripherals.
- An **Embedded System** is a microcontroller that is dedicated to a specific task; often not thought of as a computer.
- Embedded systems should be matched to their task: Too much computing power = lower battery life, higher cost
- An atom is the smallest unit of computer code. It cannot be interrupted.

Great question! Here's a clear breakdown of the differences between **embedded systems** and **general-purpose computing systems**:
## üîå **Embedded System**
### üß≠ What It Is:

# Bit Twiddling
Bit twiddling in Arduino (or any C/C++ program running on microcontrollers like the AVR-based Arduino Uno) involves using **bitwise operations** to directly manipulate individual bits of variables or hardware registers. Here's a quick guide to common bit twiddling techniques in Arduino:

### üîß Common Bit Twiddling Operations

| Operation                      | Code Example                   | Description                         |                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Set a bit**                  | \`PORTB                        | = (1 << 2);\`                       | Sets bit 2 of `PORTB` to 1     |
| **Clear a bit**                | `PORTB &= ~(1 << 2);`          | Clears bit 2 of `PORTB` (sets to 0) |                                |
| **Toggle a bit**               | `PORTB ^= (1 << 2);`           | Toggles bit 2 of `PORTB`            |                                |
| **Check if bit is set**        | `if (PORTB & (1 << 2)) {...}`  | Tests if bit 2 of `PORTB` is 1      |                                |
| **Write a bit (set or clear)** | \`PORTB = (PORTB & \~(1 << 2)) | (val << 2);\`                       | Writes `val` (0 or 1) to bit 2 |

### üß† Example: Blinking an LED with Bit Twiddling
```cpp
void setup() {
  DDRB |= (1 << DDB5); // Set pin 13 (PB5) as output
}

void loop() {
  PORTB |= (1 << PORTB5);  // Set PB5 HIGH
  delay(500);
  PORTB &= ~(1 << PORTB5); // Set PB5 LOW
  delay(500);
}
```
This turns on and off the built-in LED on pin 13 using direct port manipulation.

### üí° Why Bit Twiddle?

* **Faster** than `digitalWrite()`
* **More control** over hardware (multiple bits at once)
* **Essential** for low-level operations like setting timer registers, SPI control, etc.

# UART Serial
- UART is full duplex but slow
- Every UART character needs a start bit and at least one stop bit
- Time to send string = #char * #bits / baud
- Processor does not wait after sending string
- Interrupts tell when Rx or Tx is complete
- USB is half duplex but fast
- Other forms of serial include SPI, I2C and CAN

**UART Serial** (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a **hardware communication protocol** that allows two devices to exchange data **asynchronously**, meaning there's no shared clock signal. It's one of the most common ways microcontrollers like an **Arduino** talk to other devices like computers, sensors, or Bluetooth modules.

### üîå Key Features of UART:
* **Two wires**:
  * **TX** (Transmit): sends data
  * **RX** (Receive): receives data
* **Asynchronous**: both sides agree on a common **baud rate** (speed), but don't share a clock.
* **Serial data transmission**: sends one bit at a time.
* **Start and stop bits** frame each byte of data.
* Often includes **parity bits** for basic error checking (optional).

### üß† UART in Arduino:
Arduino provides built-in UART support via the `Serial` object:
```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Start UART at 9600 baud
  Serial.println("Hello!");
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) {
    char c = Serial.read();   // Read incoming character
    Serial.write(c);          // Echo it back
  }
}
```
### üõ∞Ô∏è Uses:

* Communicating with a PC via USB-to-serial (Arduino Uno uses ATmega16U2 as USB-to-UART bridge)
* Connecting to GPS modules, Bluetooth (like HC-05), ESP8266/ESP32 modules, etc.

# Interrupts
A running process can pause when an interrupt takes over
- The interrupt must not corrupt registers or data used by others
- Lock out interrupts while manipulating any variables that could be changed by interrupts.
- Minimize time in interrupt service routines
- ‚Äúvolatile‚Äù warns the compiler not to optimize variables
- 2 external interrupts on Uno; 6 on Mega
- Interrupt vector table provides many more 

 
Initialize all variables; reset will not restore original values
- **EEPROM** is meant for parameters that seldom change
- Interrupts can remove the need for blocking code.
- Think of the worst case for interrupts happening at the wrong time and prevent it.
- Integer arithmetic is faster than floating point
- A union can remove the need to cast to another type
- Keypad outputs to rows and reads columns.

const int circum = 397
- stores in flash mem
- without const, it does to ram 

#define circum = 397
- takes the text 'circum and replaces it with 397

**Interrupts** are a fundamental feature in microcontrollers (like the one in an Arduino) that **temporarily pause the normal execution of code** to immediately respond to important events ‚Äî like a button press, a sensor signal, or a timer expiring.

### ‚ö° What is an Interrupt?

Think of it like this:

> You're reading a book (your `loop()` function), and someone taps you on the shoulder to tell you something important. You stop reading, deal with the situation (interrupt), and then go back to your book.

### üß† Why Use Interrupts?
* Efficient: You **don‚Äôt have to constantly check** (poll) a pin or timer ‚Äî the system alerts you.
* Fast: The microcontroller **reacts immediately** to critical events.
* Accurate: Especially helpful for **precise timing**, like pulse-width measurements or responding to real-time input.

### üö® Common Interrupt Sources:

* **External interrupts**: triggered by changes on certain pins (e.g., a button press)
* **Timer interrupts**: triggered at regular intervals
* **Serial interrupts**: when data arrives via UART

### üß™ Example in Arduino (Button on Pin 2):
```cpp
volatile bool flag = false;

void setup() {
  pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);              // Attach button to pin 2
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(2), handleInterrupt, FALLING);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  if (flag) {
    Serial.println("Button Pressed!");
    flag = false;
  }
}

void handleInterrupt() {
  flag = true;
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Interrupt Tips:
* **Keep interrupt functions short** ‚Äî no `delay()`, `Serial.print()`, or long logic.
* Use `volatile` for variables shared between `loop()` and ISR (Interrupt Service Routine).
* Some interrupts disable other operations temporarily ‚Äî plan accordingly.

## Round off
``` cpp
long int mvolts = (5000* analogRead(A1)) / 1023; 
int temp_C = mvolts/10 -50;
int temp_F  = 9 * temp_C / 5 + 32; 
// What is the problem?
```

- int doesnt take into account of decimals (my guess prob wrong)

### Avoiding Round off

```cpp
long int mvolts = (5000 * analogRead(A1)) / 1023;
long int temp_Cx10 = mvolts - 500;
int temp_F  = 5 * temp_Cx10 / 90 + 32; 
int temp_C = tempCx10 / 10;
int fraction = tempCx10 % 10;
printf(‚Äú%3d.%-1d C\n‚Äù, temp_C, fraction);
```





# Timers
- Both the Uno and Mega have two 8-bit counter/timers
- Uno has one 16-bit timer; Mega has four
- When input is an oscillator, it is a timer; events as input make it a counter
- Timers are configured by several special purpose registers
- Interrupt on overflow from 0xFF to 0 (8-bit) or 0xFFFF to 0 (16-bit)
- Putting the right number in the timer gets an interrupt when time has elapsed
- Can divide the system clock by 1, 8, 64, 256 or 1024

**Timers** in Arduino (and microcontrollers in general) are built-in hardware modules that count clock cycles to help you **measure time**, **generate accurate delays**, and **create PWM signals** without relying on software `delay()` functions.

### üîß What Can Timers Do?
1. **Measure time** (e.g., how long a button is held)
2. **Generate delays** (precise microsecond/millisecond intervals)
3. **Create PWM signals** (used for dimming LEDs, controlling servos, etc.)
4. **Trigger interrupts** (run code at regular intervals)
5. **Count external events** (like pulses from a sensor)

### ‚è≤Ô∏è How Timers Work
Timers count at a set rate derived from the Arduino's clock (usually 16 MHz). You can control:
* The **prescaler** (slows the counting rate)
* The **top value** (where the timer resets)
* What to do on **overflow** or **compare match**

### ‚åõ Example Use in PWM
Arduino uses timers to create analog-like output with `analogWrite()`:

```cpp
analogWrite(9, 127); // Uses Timer1 on pin 9 to output PWM
```

### üß† Types on Arduino Uno:
* **Timer0**: Used by `millis()`, `delay()`, etc.
* **Timer1**: 16-bit, good for servo control
* **Timer2**: 8-bit, can also be used for custom PWM or tone

## Music with timer: Globals

```cpp
/* Tune: Twinkle, Twinkle
  Note                    F4,   F4,   C5,    C5,  D5,  D5,   C5
Frequency (Hz)  349, 349, 523, 523, 587, 587, 523
Duration  (ms)   500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 1000
Use timer/counter 2 overflow to set frequency.
Use time/counter 1 overflow for duration
frequency in Hz; half period in Œºs
    For range of E1 (41 Hz) to G6 (1568 Hz) period is 24,390 us to 6 Œº s */
#define HALF_PERIOD_us(frequency) (1000000 / (2*frequency)
#define NOTE_COUNT 7
const long int note_gap_ms = 50;     // time between notes
short int note_index = 0;  // global
bool resting = FALSE;   //global
```

## Set note duration timer
``` cpp
int set_timer1(duration_ms)  {   // 16-bit timer
// for times of 50 to 1000 ms
// divisor is 1024; clock is 62.5 ns; tick is 64 us
TCCR1B &= ~(0x02); TCCR1B |= 0x05; // divisor = 1024
unsigned long int ticks = duration_ms * 1000 / 64;
if (--ticks > 0xFFFF) ticks = 0xFFFF;
// Set timer for the duration of the note
OCR1A =  0xFFFF ‚Äì ticks;  
}

```

## Set frequency timer
``` cpp
int set_timer2(frequency)  {
/* For range of E1 (41 Hz) to G6 (1568 Hz) period is  24,390 us to 6 us */
    unsigned long int time_ns = HALF_PERIOD_us(frequency) * 1000;
// assume 62.5 ns clock 
   unsigned int ticks = (time_ns * 2) / 130;   // 48 to 390,240 for tones
if (ticks <= 32)                {TCCR2B =  0x01;      divisor = 1; }
else if (ticks <= 1024)   (TCCR2B =  0x04;      divisor = 64;}
else                                  {TCCR2B =  0x07;     divisor =1024;}
ticks *= divisor;  
if (--ticks > 0xFF) ticks = 0xFF;
OCR2A =  0xFF ‚Äì ticks;  // Set timer to produce a square wave on speaker }
```

## Interrupt to toggle frequency
``` cpp
ISR(TIMER2_OVF_vect) {  // on overflow interrupt from timer 2
// for speaker connected to D7 of Uno (Port D7)
If (resting) 
    PORTD &= ~ (1<<PB7);  // clear speaker pin
else 
    PORTD ^= (1<<PB7);   // toggle the output port// could use digital.write to pin 7 but it may not be fast enough
}
```

## Interrupt to go to next note
``` cpp
ISR(TIMER1_OVF) {  // on overflow interrupt from timer 1 for note duration
resting = !resting;    // set a gap between notes
if (resting)  { PORTD &= ~ (1<<PB7);  // clear speaker pin
         set_timer1(note_gap_ms);      }
else {
    if (++note_index > = NOTE_COUNT)  return;
    set_timer2(Frequency[note_index]);
    set_timer1(Duration[note_index]);
    PORTD |= (1<<PB7);  // Speaker high }  }
```








# PWM
- is a square wave
- Compiler can generate a .lst file showing the assembly language instructions.
- We generally want to have delays in the loop() to keep it from going too fast
- AVR‚Äôs PWM is a digital square wave faking an analog signal; sometimes OK; sometimes not.
- PWM on AVR uses duty cycle @ 490 Hz or 980 Hz
- Servos want a pulse (typically 30 Hz) between 1 and 2 ms wide. 

**PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** is a technique used to simulate (faking -tim) analog voltage levels using digital signals. It rapidly turns a digital pin **on and off** at a fixed frequency, and the **ratio of on-time to off-time** (called the *duty cycle*) determines the effective output voltage or power.

### üîß How PWM Works:
A square wave is generated, and its **duty cycle** (the percentage of time it's "on") determines the average output:
* **0% duty cycle** = always off (0V)
* **50% duty cycle** = on half the time (about 2.5V if using 5V)
* **100% duty cycle** = always on (5V)

### ‚ö° Uses of PWM:
* **Dimming LEDs**
* **Controlling motor speed**
* **Generating audio signals**
* **Controlling servos (with modified PWM timing)**

### üß™ Arduino Example:
```cpp
analogWrite(9, 127); // 50% duty cycle on pin 9 (out of 255)
```
This will make an LED appear half as bright as full power.

### üõ†Ô∏è Pins with PWM on Arduino Uno:
PWM-capable pins are usually marked with a `~` symbol:
**3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11**








# Sensors and Actuators
- Many kinds of sensors can be input
- An analog input depends both on the accuracy of the sensor and the resolution of the ADC
- An actuator lets the system change the environment ‚Äì it often involves controlling a motor.
- Sensors or actuators may have their own dedicated microcontroller.
- Small motors may be controlled by PWM or pulses; bigger ones may need a relay or opto-isolator.

### üîç **Sensors and Actuators** are two fundamental components used in embedded systems, robotics, IoT, and automation:

## üß≠ **Sensors**
**Definition:** A sensor is a device that **detects or measures physical conditions** and converts them into electrical signals that a microcontroller (like an Arduino) can read.

### üìè Examples of Sensors:
* **Temperature** ‚Üí TMP36, LM35
* **Light** ‚Üí Photoresistor (LDR), TSL2561
* **Distance** ‚Üí Ultrasonic (HC-SR04), IR sensors
* **Motion** ‚Üí PIR sensor, Accelerometer (MPU6050)
* **Pressure, gas, humidity, sound**, etc.

### üß† Sensor Output:
* Analog (varying voltage) ‚Üí e.g., 0‚Äì5V
* Digital (HIGH/LOW or serial data) ‚Üí e.g., 1 or 0

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Actuators**
**Definition:** An actuator is a device that **performs a physical action** based on electrical input, often from a microcontroller or controller system.

### üõ†Ô∏è Examples of Actuators:
* **Motors** ‚Üí DC motor, servo motor, stepper motor
* **LEDs** ‚Üí Light up or blink
* **Relays** ‚Üí Switch larger electrical loads
* **Speakers** ‚Üí Sound output
* **Linear actuators** ‚Üí Create straight-line motion

### üîÑ Input from Controller:
Actuators take commands (e.g., PWM or digital signals) and turn them into **movement, light, sound, or force**.

### üß© Summary:

| Device   | Direction | Converts        | Example Use              |
| -------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Sensor   | Input     | Physical ‚Üí Data | Measure room temperature |
| Actuator | Output    | Data ‚Üí Action   | Open a door with a motor |
