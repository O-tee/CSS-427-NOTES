Step Resolution
- Suppose that a sensor has a 5V range.
- If it is sampled by an 8-bit ADC, there are 256 possibilities.
- The minimal detectable voltage change is 5V/255 = 20 mV.
- With a 10-bit ADC: 5V/1023 = 5 mv.
- With a 12-bit ADC: 5V/4095 = 1.2 mv.
- The resolution of the sensor needs to match the ADC
