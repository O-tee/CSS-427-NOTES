EEPROM
- EEPROM or E2PROM is a type of non-volatile memory. It is used in computers, usually integrated in microcontrollers such as smart cards and remote keyless systems, or as a separate chip device, to store relatively small amounts of data by allowing individual bytes to be erased and reprogrammed.

Most Arduinos are powered by 5V. The Due is a 3.3V part. IF YOU CONNECT A 5V INPUT TO THE DUE, YOU WILL DESTROY THE PART.

While the AVR and ARM are very different instruction sets, the Arduino IDE cross compiler can handle either of them.
