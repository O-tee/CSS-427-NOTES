## Things I'm confused about 

## After class TODO

## Notes 

Fundamentals
- Carrier Frequency
  - Central band
  - For WiFi: 2.4 GHz
- Modulation = Data
  - Audio range is 20 Hz to 20 KHz
  - Fault tolerance and throughput
- Transmission / Reception Power
  - Range and sensitivity
- Channel
  - Interference and capacity

IEEE 802 Working Groups
- 802.2: Logical Link Control
- 802.3: Ethernet
- 802.11: Wi-Fi
- 802.15: Wireless Personal Area Network
  - 802.15.1: Bluetooth
  - 802.15.4: Low-Rate Wireless PAN, e.g., ZigBee
- The services and protocols specified in IEEE 802 map to the lower two layers (Data Link and Physical) of the seven-layer OSI networking reference model
- IEEE 802 splits the OSI Data Link Layer into two sub-layers named Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC)



IEEE 802 LAN protocols
- 802.11 is the wireless LAN section
  - media access control (MAC)
  - physical layer (PHY) protocols
  - wireless local area network (WLAN) Wi-Fi communication
- WLAN has evolved over time

Wi-Fi Direct
- Both Ad-hoc mode and Wi-Fi Direct allow devices to connect directly to each other (P2P), without the use of an Access Point
- Wi-Fi Direct is a protocol for forming hierarchical groups, and mostly used to connect just two devices
  - It does not scale beyond a few devices in close proximity
- The devices are only equal peers until they connect to each other, and one of them becomes group owner
- After establishment of connection, both devices follow the hierarchical roles of AP and client – master and slave
